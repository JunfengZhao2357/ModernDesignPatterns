This repository contains samples of common design patterns written in modern C++. 

This is intended for learning purposes of new C++ features and a starting point for implementing a pattern in your system.

Every subfolder contains another *README.md* with detailed explanation.

## Patterns

The patterns included in this repo are:

- [x] [Strategy & Prototype Pattern](StrategyPrototypePattern/)
- [x] [Observer Pattern](ObserverPattern/)
- [x] [Factory Pattern](FactoryPattern/)
- [x] [Abstract Factory Pattern](AbstractFactoryPattern/)
- [x] [Singleton Pattern](SingletonPattern/)

## Building

To build the project (Unix):

```bash
$ mkdir build && cd build/
$ cmake ../
$ make
```

`cmake` and a GCC version that supports C++17 are required for this.
